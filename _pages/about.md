# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

I'm still learning how to create a website using **rmarkdown** and **Github**. Text is also still not proof-read.

## PhD

I work with social and vocal complexity in parrots. I try to understand if parrots living in a more complex social context develop more a complex vocal communication system. For this I study the monk parakeet, which is an invasive species in many European cities. Furthermore, I study how vocal systems co-evolve with social systems. Looking at the same question from an ultimate perspective. Besides doing comparative analysis of parrots at the species level, I will again use monk parakeets to see if there is a signal of cultural evolution of vocal systems. I will compare populations in Europe with different invasion histories to see if new or altered vocalisations are innovated and retained in the population.

## General interests

Broadly I'm interested in understanding how and why cumulative cultures evolve. I'm especially interested in how communication systems can evolve, both in a species, but also how they can different between populations. To better understand this I would love to study the ontogeny of a vocal repertoire both in the wild and in hand-reared individuals. 

I like to approach these questions using three different approaches. 

1. During my masters I worked as an animal trainer and got to work with grey seals, great cormorants and common murres. I have also worked with several species of tits and bats. I love to work in close contact with animals and think a lot of interesting questions can be answered with well trained or short-term captive animals. 

2. For my PhD most of the work is in the field, where I can observe the parrots natural behaviour in the wild. 

3. Last but not least, I work with different analytical approaches and I'm always happy to work on agent based models or more generally Bayesian statistics. This has already led to a publication together with members of Lucy Aplin's and Damien Farine's lab.
