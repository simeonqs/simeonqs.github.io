## PhD

I'm broadly interested in the evolution of complex cognition and culture. More specifically I focus on the emergence of socially learned vocal behaviours in parrots. I study vocalisations and social behaviour of the monk parakeet, an invasive parrot in many European cities. I also do comparative work trying to link vocal complexity, social complexity, brain size and longevity across parrots. I'm supervised by Dr. Lucy Aplin and Dr. Mary Brooke McElreath. 

In our latest [publication](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2397), we estimated life expectancy for 217 parrot species and showed that increased longevity is driven by a direct effect of relative brain size. A nice summary of this study can be found [here](https://www.ab.mpg.de/472408/news_publication_18488364_transferred?c=3273). 

Ongoing work includes:

* A field study of dialect patterns in monk parakeets across their European invasive range (together Stephen Tyndel)
* A field study of vocal and social complexity in monk parakeets in Barcelona (in collaboration with Dr. Juan Carlos Senar)

*Tagged monk parakeet preening its partner (that managed to remove its tag) in Ciutadella park, Barcelona.*

## General interests

I like to approach these questions using three different approaches. 

1. During my masters I worked as an animal trainer and got to work with grey seals, great cormorants and common murres. I have also worked with several species of tits and bats. I love to work in close contact with animals and think a lot of interesting questions can be answered with well trained or short-term captive animals. 

2. For my PhD most of the work is in the field, where I can observe the parrots natural behaviour in the wild. 

3. Last but not least, I work with different analytical approaches and I'm always happy to work on agent based models or more generally Bayesian statistics. This has led to a [publication](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.3107) together with members of Lucy Aplins and Damien Farines lab.
