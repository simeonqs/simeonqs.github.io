## Post-doc

I'm currently employed as a post-doc at EcoScience, Aarhus University, where I work on monitoring bat activity above land and sea. We use machine learning in combination with passive acoustic monitoring and also employ MOTUS tags to detect individuals directly. I'm also still wrapping up my final PhD chapters, see below. 

## PhD

I'm broadly interested in the evolution of complex cognition and culture. More specifically I focus on the emergence of socially learned vocal behaviours in parrots. I study vocalisations and social behaviour of the monk parakeet, an invasive parrot in many European cities. I also do comparative work trying to link vocal complexity, social complexity, brain size and longevity across parrots. I'm supervised by Dr. Lucy Aplin and Dr. Mary Brooke McElreath. 

In our latest [publication](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rspb.2021.2397), we estimated life expectancy for 217 parrot species and showed that increased longevity is driven by a direct effect of relative brain size. A nice summary of this study can be found [here](https://www.ab.mpg.de/472408/news_publication_18488364_transferred?c=3273). This also led to a [short methods paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.9273) outlining how (not) to include relative brain size in a regression.

Ongoing work includes:

* A field study of dialect patterns in monk parakeets across their European invasive range (together Stephen Tyndel)
* A field study of individual signature within and across call types in mon parakeets (in collaboration with Dr. Juan Carlos Senar)
* A field study of vocal and social complexity in monk parakeets in Barcelona (in collaboration with Dr. Juan Carlos Senar)
* A field study of sequence complexity and repertoire size of monk parakeets across European cities of different population size and ages
