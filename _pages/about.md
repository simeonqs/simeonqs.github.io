## PhD

I work with social and vocal complexity in parrots. I try to understand if parrots living in a more complex social context develop more a complex vocal communication system. For this I study the monk parakeet, which is an invasive species in many European cities. Furthermore, I study how vocal systems co-evolve with social systems. Looking at the same question from an ultimate perspective. Besides doing comparative analysis of parrots at the species level, I will again use monk parakeets to see if there is a signal of cultural evolution of vocal systems. I will compare populations in Europe with different invasion histories to see if new or altered vocalisations are innovated and retained in the population. I'm supervised by Dr. Lucy Aplin and Dr. Mary Brooke McElreath. 

Ongoing work includes:

* A comparative study into how relative brain size can have driven the evolution of long lifespans in parrots (in collaboration with Professor Dalia Amor Conde); for preliminary results see [my talk at ASAB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuZCXxjj8S8&t=79s)
* A field study of dialect patterns in monk parakeets across their European invasive range (together Stephen Tyndel)
* A field study of vocal and social complexity in monk parakeets in Barcelona (in collaboration with Dr. Juan Carlos Senar)

## General interests

Broadly I'm interested in understanding how and why cumulative cultures evolve. I'm especially interested in how communication systems can evolve, both in a species, but also how they can differ between populations. To better understand this I would love to study the ontogeny of a vocal repertoire both in the wild and in hand-reared individuals. 

I like to approach these questions using three different approaches. 

1. During my masters I worked as an animal trainer and got to work with grey seals, great cormorants and common murres. I have also worked with several species of tits and bats. I love to work in close contact with animals and think a lot of interesting questions can be answered with well trained or short-term captive animals. 

2. For my PhD most of the work is in the field, where I can observe the parrots natural behaviour in the wild. 

3. Last but not least, I work with different analytical approaches and I'm always happy to work on agent based models or more generally Bayesian statistics. This has already led to a [publication](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2020.3107) together with members of Lucy Aplin's and Damien Farine's lab.
