# UNDER DEVELOPMENT

I'm still learning how to create a website using **rmarkdown** and **Github**. Text is also still not proof-read.

## PhD

I work with social and vocal complexity in parrots. I try to understand if parrots living in a more complex social context develop more a complex vocal communication system. For this I study the monk parakeet, which is an invasive species in many European cities. Furthermore, I study how vocal systems co-evolve with social systems. Looking at the same question from an ultimate perspective. Besides doing comparative analysis of parrots at the species level, I will again use monk parakeets to see if there is a signal of cultural evolution of vocal systems. I will compare populations in Europe with different invasion histories to see if new or altered vocalisations are innovated and retained in the population.

## General interests

Broadly I'm interested in understanding how and why cumulative cultures evolve. I'm especially interested in how communication systems can evolve, both in a species, but also how they can different between populations. To better understand this I would love to study the ontogeny of a vocal repertoire both in the wild and in hand-reared individuals. 

I like to approach these questions using three different approaches. 

1. During my masters I worked as an animal trainer and got to work with grey seals, great cormorants and common murres. I have also worked with several species of tits and bats. I love to work in close contact with animals and think a lot of interesting questions can be answered with well trained or short-term captive animals. 

2. For my PhD most of the work is in the field, where I can observe the parrots natural behaviour in the wild. 

3. Last but not least, I work with different analytical approaches and I'm always happy to work on agent based models or more generally Bayesian statistics. This has already led to a publication together with members of Lucy Aplin's and Damien Farine's lab. 

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

More info about configuring academicpages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
