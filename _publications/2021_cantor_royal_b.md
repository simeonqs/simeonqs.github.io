This paper was the result of the joint journal club of the Farine and Aplin labs. Mauricio, Michael and I shared the first authorship, but it was really a team effort with everybody contributing with their expertise. This paper went from the initial idea to the first draft within a few weeks and is by far the most enjoyable project I have worked on until now.
